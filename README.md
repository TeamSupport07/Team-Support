Byte Verse Hackathon 2024

The Core Idea and the Objective of the Project :

The core idea of the project is to enable the users to check their Xrays and identify whether they are suffering from any disease, we have specifically implied upon 2 specific diseases i.e. Pneumonia and Brain Tumors the user simply needs to upload their X-ray on our created website or an app, after uploading the Xray by clicking on the predict tab the user will get whether he is normal or suffering from any disease, we have created 2 predictive models for predicting disease of brain tumor and pneumonia at the backend and at the frontend, we have a website where the user will upload its Xray.

Main Objectives: 1. Provide Convenience to the user to identify whether they are suffering from any disease or not, at their ease.


Current Functionality and Features Implemented: Currently we have successfully been able to complete our Pneumonia Predictive Model and a website has been under process for the same and as well and simple app is been made that will predict the disease as well as a brain tumor predictive model is under process.

Technologies and tools have been used are: We have used Google Collab and Jupyter Notebook for making the predictive models as well using HTML, CSS, and Java script for creating and website and tools like ChatGPT for certain help in case of errors as well Visual Studio code for making a general app for predicting the X-ray results.

We have accomplished making a predictive model of Pneumonia disease and Brain tumor Predictive model under process, created a website for the same which the user can visit to check their disease, and an app for their convenience.

Our future plans and goals to implement the website globally and the app successfully and as well completing the task of the brain tumor predicting model and uploading it to the website.
