We are Enthusiast in technical fields and have developed certain skills for working and providing our best in technological fields

Themes and Tracks: We have selected the theme of  "HEALTH CARE AND MEDICAL" , tracks we have used are Web Development, App development, ArtificialÂ Intelligence.

Title: HEALTH CARE AND MEDICAL

Description: Heath care and medical are some of the essential need of a human being, if an human is alive health care and medical is required for an human. Some peoples are afraid of visiting a medical for their checkups and some are worried about were they checked properly for their symptoms and given right advices for the same. Therefore, we have created certain models which would predict whether a person is suffering from a disease or checking that they have been checked properly. Where the user needs to simply visit our website or an app where they have to upload their Xray of theirs, specifically we have made models and given a portal of website, for predicting whether the person is suffering from Pneumonia or is normal due to certain chest pains user is worried about the user would have to provide Xrays of their chest and check whether they are suffering or not or if a person is having a severe head pain another model is been created which would predict whether the user is suffering from brain tumor or not, user can refer to our website or app to check their details, to get the right medication if they are needed for the same.

Tech Stacks Used:  Web Development- HTML,CSS,JAVA SCRIPT.
                   Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Using Python Programming Language and its libraries.

Installation Steps: 1. Download all modules and python libraries i.e. MatplotLib,Seaborn,Scikit-learn,TensorFlow,Keras,Gradio,os,cv2,pandas,tkinter,Numpy,flask.
                    2. Run the html code in visual studio code which would generate 2 specific links by clicking on 2nd link you anyone will be able to access the website, due to some reason website can't be 
                       uploaded globally.
                    3. For both the app models code of both is provided with the same, just run the given program in Visual Studio Code and which would provide a prompt of browsing an image, browse the XRAY and 
                       upload it at the prompt and click on predict which would give a output whether the Xray is normal or user is suffering from any disease
                    4. For accessing our code one can use google colab and visual studio any of these

Libraries and Dependencies: Python Libraries been used i.e. MatplotLib,Seaborn,Scikit-learn,TensorFlow2.15.0,Keras 2.15.0,Gradio,os,cv2,pandas,tkinter,Numpy,flask.
